## 1. Why We Measure

Open-source communities thrive when growth, quality, and engagement are visible.
Tracking metrics allows us to:

- **Identify friction early** — a spike in unanswered issues signals overload before contributors burn out.
- **Prove value to funders and partners** — concrete numbers justify continued investment from the Stellar Development Foundation.
- **Reward contributors fairly** — contribution counts feed directly into the [recognition system](./recognition-system.md).
- **Guide the roadmap** — high-traffic documentation areas indicate where new examples are most needed.

> All metrics are collected in aggregate. No personally identifiable information beyond
> GitHub usernames (which are already public) is stored or reported.

## 4. Tracking Tools & Collection

### 4.1 GitHub Native Insights

GitHub provides built-in analytics at no cost:

| Tool | Data Provided | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository Insights → Traffic** | Clones, unique visitors, referring sites | Maintainers only (Settings → Insights → Traffic) |
| **Repository Insights → Contributors** | Commit activity per contributor | Public |
| **GitHub Actions Summary** | CI pass/fail history | Public (`.github/workflows/`) |
| **Dependabot Alerts** | Dependency security status | Maintainers only |

### 4.2 Automated Collection via GitHub Actions

A scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/community-metrics.yml`) runs every Monday
at 09:00 UTC and:

1. Calls the **GitHub REST API** to collect the weekly snapshot of issues, PRs, and discussion counts.
2. Appends a row to [`docs/community-dashboard.md`](./community-dashboard.md) inside the rolling data table.
3. Posts a **GitHub Discussions summary** for community visibility.
4. Opens a labeled issue (`metrics-alert`) if any alert threshold is breached.

See [§ 6 Alert Thresholds](#6-alert-thresholds) for the list of conditions that trigger an alert.

### 4.3 External / Optional Tools

The following tools can be adopted if maintainer capacity allows:

| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Orbit.love](https://orbit.love) | Multi-channel community activity aggregation | Free tier available |
| [Stargazers](https://github.com/nicedoc/stargazers) | Star growth analytics | Free, self-hosted |
| [Codecov](https://codecov.io) | Coverage trend visualization (already integrated) | Free for public repos |
| [Open Collective Insights](https://opencollective.com) | Financial health if a fund is established | Free |

> Start with native GitHub Insights and the automated workflow. Add external tools
> only when the native data is insufficient for a specific decision.

### 4.4 Survey Infrastructure

Periodic community surveys are managed through the
[feedback system](./feedback-system/README.md). Surveys are:

- Distributed via GitHub Discussions and the Stellar Community Discord `#soroban` channel.
- Run quarterly using the template in `docs/feedback-system/surveys/`.
- Analyzed by a maintainer, with results published in the monthly report.

## 5. Reporting Cadence

| **Weekly** (every Monday) | Automated snapshot appended to dashboard | GitHub Actions bot | Maintainers (GitHub issue) |
| **Monthly** (1st of month) | Narrative summary + trend analysis | Rotating maintainer | Community (GitHub Discussions) |
| **Quarterly** (Jan / Apr / Jul / Oct) | Full health report with satisfaction survey | Core team | Public (README + Discussions) |

### Monthly Report Template

## 6. Alert Thresholds

When any of the following conditions are detected by the automated workflow, a
GitHub issue is automatically opened with label `metrics-alert` and assigned to
the on-call maintainer:

| Condition | Threshold | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| CI Pass Rate drops | < 95% on `main` over 7 days | Critical |
| Test Coverage drops | < 85% on latest run | Critical |
| Clippy warnings appear | > 0 on `main` | Critical |
| Median issue response time | > 72 hours in rolling 7 days | Warning |
| Median PR review time | > 5 days in rolling 7 days | Warning |
| Issues close rate | < 50% for the month | Warning |
| No new contributors | 0 new merged contributors in 60 days | Warning |
| Community satisfaction drops | Survey score < 3.5 / 5 | High |
| CoC incident reported | Any confirmed incident | Critical |

## 7. How to Contribute to Metrics

Community members can help improve metric quality:

- **Submit feedback** — use the [feedback form](./feedback-system/forms/feedback-form-template.md)
  to report friction points that might not appear in raw numbers.
- **Participate in surveys** — quarterly survey links are posted in GitHub Discussions
  and the Stellar Community Discord.
- **Flag anomalies** — if you notice a metric that seems wrong (e.g., a bot inflating
  counts), open an issue tagged `metrics-anomaly`.
- **Propose new metrics** — open a Discussion thread in the `Ideas` category.
