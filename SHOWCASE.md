# Soroban Cookbook Showcase

This page highlights **10+ real projects** in the Stellar ecosystem built on
Soroban that follow the patterns documented in the Soroban Cookbook. They cover
streaming payments, NFTs, oracles, block explorers, verification tools,
crowdfunding, and developer infrastructure across the Stellar network and the
Drips Wave ecosystem.

> Each entry includes a **Confirmation** status. Projects that have not yet been
> verified by their maintainers are marked `pending`; a project becomes
> `confirmed` once its maintainer confirms the cookbook (or its patterns) were
> used. See the [Project Tracking](#project-tracking) section for the workflow.

The showcase fulfills **Phase 8, Issue #441: "10+ Projects Built"**. The goal is
to demonstrate that the cookbook's examples and patterns are used by shipping,
production-grade Stellar / Soroban projects, and to make it easy for developers
to discover and learn from them.

## Case Studies

### Streaming Payments at Scale (SoroStream / StellarStream)
Both streaming protocols reuse the cookbook's **storage-type trade-off guide** to
decide between Persistent and Temporary storage for stream state and checkpoints.
This saved significant design time and kept rent costs predictable.

### NFT Marketplace on Soroban (soroban-nft-marketplace)
The team built directly on the cookbook's **NFT patterns & conventions** for
ownership, metadata, and marketplace design. The cookbook's escrow and
authorization examples shortened the marketplace contract compared to building
from scratch.

### Verifiable Deployments (soroban-verify)
Adopting the cookbook's **deployment and identity-management guides** let the
team standardize testnet-to-mainnet promotion, key handling, and contract
upgrades across every contract they verify.

## Project Tracking

This list is maintained as part of the Phase 8 growth milestone. A shared
spreadsheet and the Drips Wave org profile
([drips.network](https://www.drips.network/wave/orgs/694c8fb3-674a-420b-80e3-ef2ece5cc5c2))
track new projects built with the cookbook as they onboard.

### Confirmation workflow

To keep the showcase honest, every entry is assigned one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Listed for relevance, but not yet verified by the maintainer |
| `confirmed` | Maintainer confirmed the cookbook / its patterns were used (linked evidence) |

Verification steps for `pending` entries:
1. Open a short, friendly issue or comment in the project's repo, e.g. *"Hi! We
   noticed your project builds Soroban contracts. Does it use the Soroban
   Cookbook? We'd love to feature you in our showcase."*
2. Link back to this [SHOWCASE](./SHOWCASE.md) so they can see the context.
3. When the maintainer replies, update the status to `confirmed` and add a link
   to their acknowledgment.

Issue #441 is considered complete once **at least 10 projects are confirmed**.
